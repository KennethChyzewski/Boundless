# Reflection on the software development processes

Throughout the Boundless journey, a large variety of tools, techniques and conventions were utilized and experimented with.
In terms of tools: Visual Studio Code for coding both front-end and back-end frameworks, Firebase to store data of user account
information as well as the content within chatrooms and React to compile Boundless to multiple platforms and visual see the team's
progress, were all excellent tools that worked throughout the production. 

Git, being probably the most crucial tool for any multi-person development, was problematic for Boundless at certain
instances. Boundless did not utilize any visual git workflow applications, causing issues of all scales throughout the project.
Members would lose the sense of where or what other members are working on, which would cause git conflicts or branches to 
go rogue. This could have been avoided if we took the opportunity to learn and use software such as Git Kraken.

Boundless looks at techniques as more of approaches to the product, such as design patterns. Boundless implemented the MVC design
pattern expect with using Reducers, Dispatchers and Actions respectively. This structure of code allowed the team to understand
how the development of Boundless in a React environment will pan out. This technique had a large learning curve for a few team
members but in the long term, it enabled Boundless to be designed in a modular and scalable manner with clarity between how 
components entwine and work together.

Likewise, Boundless had a flawless focus towards its progression because of our two scrum masters. They ensured the team wasn't
controlled by a single person and the two scrum masters were able to provide more meaningful feedback to enhance and 
encourage the work of the other members. The scrum masters kept Boundless on its feet, always updating all the resources we had
from backlogs to the in-person meetings. This convention built a foundation for Boundless to establish that the development was 
only ever increasing.

In conclusion, Boundless had a successful work term these past five sprints but, our process needs to be more communicative. The 
team was compromised 'fast-learners', enabling us to overcome any hurdles relatively quickly. By the final sprint, Boundless
had developed a routine that could only improve in minor aspects. This includes: meeting and coding in 
person more than our twice-weekly schedule, avoid creating a new User Story for every single code change (in the final sprint,
the team had a bad habit of making every single bug a new User Story) and offer a more realistic voting methodology when selecting
what tasks a person would work on. We need to evaluate a person before assigning them a User Story and
whoever works on said User Story, the outcome is something that satisfies all members, not only the User Story owner.

All in all, it was a pleasure and we are all grateful for this opportunity to collaborate with each other and we hope to 
either continue Boundless in the near future or begin a new project that better expands our horizons.
