Boundless completed far beyond the anticapted 3-4 user stories per Sprint by completing 13 User Stories for Sprint 4. 

# Meeting Overview:
This retroactive meeting allowed the team to not only reflect upon Sprint 4 and take note of what could have been improved but,
it allowed the team to hearten with one another and take in just how far Boundless has gone. All members were present.

With the largest hurdles achieved in Sprint 3, polishing and perfecting Boundless, along with adding simplistic features to
offer a more personalized user experience, was the main focus for Sprint 4. Working towards the final stretch of the project,
the team was able to set aside any differences and collaborate on all the various User Stories to complete Boundless.

However, with a week left prior to the final presentation, there is more work to be done before publicly annoucing the product.
Our Product Owner Abode left very precise feedback, specific to the project, that will enhance the presentation of Boundless
when the time comes.

A fair amount of the recently implemented features were easy to navigate to us developers however, the average person might
have some confusion and struggle. Some of the underlying features mentioned in the feedback were: Link to Boundless' Facebook
page was misplaced on the login/ register page (potentially tricking a user to thinking they can login to Boundless via their
Facebook account, which they cannot), some dropdown menus dont properly portray the item selection we want users to see or 
they do not clearly indicate what we want the user to select and when a user wants to Update their profile, nothing notifies
them that the update was successful which can also cause confusion.

The feedback are minor flaws with easy fixes and will be fulfilled before the final presentation however, its feedback like this
that Boundless takes seriously. These errors ruin the fluidity of Boundless which could be problematic when we lose the audience
during the demonstration. 

Another point mentioned in the previous Retrospective Meeting for Sprint 3, was not only brushing up the Front-End to please users
and the Product Owner but to clean up the Back-End for us and future developers. Once the project reaches the conclusion, if at
any point in the near future the team would like to pick up where we left off, we would need to comment and clean up the code
to prevent any foreshadowed headaches. 

All in all, Sprint 4 demonstrated Boundless' accomplishments and achievements by delivering a valuable product to the Product
Owner. Sprint 3, users we only able to make accounts and communicate with one another. Sprint 4 added flavoring to Boundless, 
now allowing users search messages within chatrooms, upload files to chatrooms, select from different universities with a larger
variety of courses and display all the other members within a specific chatroom, all resulting in a more welcoming experience to
everyone.


# Meeting Conclusion:
Boundless made no mistakes for the final Sprint and delivered a product that was still within the scope of the team's aspirations.
With the remaining time before the project comes to an end, we need to make sure Boundless is look tip-top during demonstration
to wow the audience and persuade the team to eventually come back to Boundless to continue its journey.
