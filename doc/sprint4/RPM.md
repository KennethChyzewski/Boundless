1. Our product owner, Abdulwasay Mehar discussed the goals for this release along with unfinished and additional user stories we would like to complete. 
2. Release Name: Boundless 0.4
   	For this release, we hope that we are able to implement multiple chatrooms for different courses so that users can recieve the correct information about a course. Furthermore, we hope to implement the user list so that a user knows which of their peers are in a couse chatroom. 
3.  We've decided to make no changes to our definition of done. In the future, it's a possibility that we modify our definition of done as the project is approaching the end stages. 
4. Additionally, we've added addtional user stories with respect to redesigning the chat UI and user flow to allow for simplified navigation. 
5. All existing and new user stories in this release were throughly discussed in detail that was led by the product owner.
