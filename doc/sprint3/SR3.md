Boundless was able to fulfill the estimated ‘task-completion’ goal for sprint 3by completing User Stories 4, 5, 7, 8 and 23.

# Meeting Overview:
Throughout this retroactive meeting, Boundless was able to analyze why it had lost its momentum during the previous sprint and 
how it was able to recover and continue the grind with full force. All members attended this meeting.

Sprint 2 caused major revisions to the work dynamic of Boundless however, the struggles faced by boundless only made us stronger, resulting in a
successful sprint 3. All the tasks labelled in both the sprint3 and product backlog markdown files were completed without any
drastic hurdles or complications. The team was able to orchestrate a focused atmosphere that resulted in a successful sprint.

With that said, there was a single hurdle that could have been avoided and did affect our final demo. If members of the team could
more frequently communicate their progress and update on pivotal the task they are working on instead of updating the icebox only
after finishing the selected task, the group would have prevented any git conflicts. The nature of git conflicts usually occur towards the end of a project deadline and that is exactly what occured to Boundless. Merge and branch errors prevented Boundless from showing
the Product Owner the project true progress (since we had to revert to the latest working version).

Even after the arise of last minute issues, Boundless was still able to please the Product Owner with its development and received
fundamental feedback that will help us perfect the product for the upcoming sprints. Sprint 0 was planning, Sprints 1 and 2 were
implementing basic components, Sprint 3 was connecting the components together to provide functionality and Sprint 4 and 5 will
be strictly polishing.

This polishing includes beautifying our app to offer a personalized experience to all end users. For Sprint 4, we need to implement
chatroom images instead of blank placeholders, chatroom names instead of computational IDs and the customization of user profiles.
All of these modifications are geared to ensure a non-technical user can use Boundless without any prerequistie knowledge and to 
avoid having a steep learning curve to the application.

Lastly in terms of brushing up the project, we need to also clean up the code for the developers of Boundless. Once the semester is 
over, we should be able to leave the project off with clean code so in the event the team wants to pick up where they left off in a
future date, we can simply do so. Instead of spending time trying to decipher our own spaghetti code, its beneficial that the team 
produces elegant code to not only reduce foreshadowed re-examination of the project's code but, enhancing our own coding practices
for future projects.

Our accomplishments of this sprint consisted of delivering the minimum viable product to the product owner, that is, a functional
online chatroom between multiple users. Users are now able to create accounts, join chatrooms and communicate with one another. 
This successful sprint has put Boundless back on its estimated burndown path and with the constructive feedback received, Boundless
now has the stepping stones necessary to further enhance the product.

# Meeting Conclusion:
Boundless promised to deliver twice as much as anticipated due to the mishaps in the previous sprint and flourishingly did. We made
sure no errors in prior sprints reappeared and any new errors were tackled in an orderly fashion. The team now has the understanding
of how valuable team communication is, so we can prevent any silly errors like git conflicts and deliver a project at its peak.
