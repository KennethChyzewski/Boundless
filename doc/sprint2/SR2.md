# Finished tasks:
##### USER STORY 21: Add in Integrity Checks for Registration
##### USER STORY 12: Settings
##### USER STORY 20: Route Guarding
##### USER STORY 6: Chatroom Functionality

Boundless managed to complete our 3 desired User Stories (12, 20, 6) and managed to fit in the additional task of Integrity Checks for Registration (21).

# Meeting Overview:
Every Boundless member attended the sprint meeting. We absorbed the constructive feedback we received from the previous sprint and began altering our methodologies.

The feedback left us with 3 fields of improvement. User story architecture, product functionality and productivity of members. To begin with the first criticism, we came to the conclusion that breaking up a user story into ‘sub user stories’ does not suffice. We need to ensure that we keep a single feature as is and divide that story into many smaller and simpler tasks. Boundless knew the chatroom would be the largest hurdle and thus, we broke the user story into several user stories across multiple sprints. We resulted in showing a useless product that was all talk but nothing to show.
This leads into Boundless’ second fault, our approach towards the project. We knew this week was course heavy for all the members, so we orchestrated the user stories in this sprint specifically to work on the front-end design without any back-end functionality. In this instance, we failed the product owners because we did not have a functional product to bring to the table, as we are supposed to every sprint. When demonstrating the project, our deliverable was meaningless because aside from looking pretty, it offered zero purpose. This is due to the previous statement of breaking up our main user story “Chatroom functionality” into sub stories and picking the easiest and least important ones first.

Lastly, Boundless was not able to accomplish enough for the sprint. We knew ahead of time that Sprint 2 would be lack luster due to ‘post reading week’ midterms and assignments piling up but, this isn't a valid excuse for a group of seven members. We all need to contribute several hours daily on the project instead of meeting up last minute, struggling to complete tasks which then resulted in a rushed product. Boundless aims to work a lot more consistently and efficiently for the upcoming sprints to deliver a meaningful deliverable for the product owner.

Leaning away from our faults, Boundless was able to successfully keep the team updated through Pivotal Tracker and online discussion forums to prevent any stoppage in the event an issue occured. The application now has its foundation to begin implementing real operations for users to interact with one another. We have the account creation, deletion and modification, the chatroom selection menu and the chatroom screen itself, along with the database needed for user communication. Boundless takes feedback very seriously thus, we plan to revise our Product Backlog with more appropriate User Stories to ensure our next sprint more accurately depicts our goals. Boundless guarantees Sprint 3 will consist of mainly functional features that appeal so we have a proper deliverable. The team is now experienced with the technologies and APIs necessary for the project and can make progress with maximum momentum for the following sprint.

# Meeting Conclusion:
Boundless continues to improves as the mistakes from the previous sprints were not repeated but, our approach to other development paradigms were flawed, resulting in a lack of collaboration and progress. This meeting has helped shape the members of Boundless to ensure a more focused and productive working environment needed for future sprints.
