# Unfinished tasks:
USER STORY 2: Delete Account

User Story 2 diminished in value throughout the sprint as Boundless began to prioritize other User Stories that displayed a more ‘main-functionality’ omen and thus, we pushed this User Story further down the backlog, lowering its priority.

# Finished tasks:
USER STORY 16: Architecture for System interaction 
USER STORY 1: Create Account
USER STORY 17: Architecture for Redux 
USER STORY 18: Database
USER STORY 3: Login to Account
USER STORY 11: Create a biography

Boundless was able to exceed the estimated ‘task-completion’ goal by completing User Stories 11, 16, 17 and 18.

# Meeting Overview:
In this retroactive meeting, Boundless looked back and discussed parts of the sprint that went well and other parts that could use improvement. Everyone from Boundless was in attendance for this meeting. 

Our product backlog received some changes, primarily, creating a few new User Stories to reflect the ongoing changes we had decided on while developing components in sprint 1. This included the rework of prioritization for some User Stories. We had made changes to the general architecture of our platform that caused other User Stories to be of a higher significance and others to have lower significance. These changes were decided after consulting with all group members during this meeting.   

We reflected on our use of Pivotal Tracker as most of us were not aware due to unclear and missing instructions of adding in tasks when completing a User Story. We’ve decided that as soon as the product owners for a User Story starts development, they need to immediately add the specific task they’re working on for that User Story. They also need to continuously update the activity tab regarding their progress, as well as update the team through other communication means, for example, Messenger. 

Some areas of improvement we can make going forward into sprint 2 includes:
Meeting up more frequently in person to better coordinate user stories and discussing pull requests.
Establish an additional communication channel for emergency bugs and features where all team members can view and respond quickly.
Creating and maintaining smaller groups for various user stories. 
Ensuring that we keep our vision of delivering a high quality product. 
Utilizing our resources (Pivotal Tracker specifically) to keep the entire group up-to-speed when collaborating.

Our accomplishments of this sprint consisted of completing the integration of the database to our front-end UI where users are able to register and login seamlessly. However, for the deletion-of-account functionality, we revised our future sprints to incorporate this User Story. Furthermore, finishing our system design document that included the system architecture diagram, helps us better plan tasks and understand our vision of Boundless. 

On the flip side, some of our failures as a team was the lack of communication. This resulted in many easy-to-avoid situations such as git conflicts, causing additional hurdles that slowed the momentum of the team’s progression. Another hurdle that Boundless is still detecting and managing are the wide variety of new technologies. The team is comprised of members who have never heard of, let alone used, some of the tools utilized within the project such as Firebase and React. The team collectively, had to spend countless hours researching these technologies and how we can integrate them into Boundless.

# Meeting Conclusion:
Boundless analyzed our situations with regards to updating Pivotal Tracker upon completing and adding new tasks.  Boundless came to the conclusion that we need to have more in-person meetings than our current ‘once-a-week’ paradigm. We finalized how to we plan to improve and maintain faultlessness throughout future sprints.
