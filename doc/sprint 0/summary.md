Project Objectives
---------------------------
1. Create account management system
	- Develop an account management system for university students, our primary users, to register. After registering, they will have access to:
		- All group chats of courses their enrolled into for the year. Within each group chat, they may view, comment, and share information related to that course.  
2. User Interface (UI) for users to browse through their various group chats
	- Design an easy to navigate user interface, allowing users to swiftly switch between group chats, reply with ease on their current group chat, and browse around the platform. 
3. Notification system to alert users to new messages.
	- Creating a responsive notification system that informs users as quickly as possible when new information arrives from each group chat. 
4. Reporting system
	- Report users who act in an inappropriate conduct anonymously. These reports are sent to the moderator.

	
Key Users
---------------------------
1. University Students
	- Our primary user of the platform will be university students. They will be a student who is enrolled in courses at an accredited university who can be majoring in any program and in any year. They will be constantly viewing, commenting, and interacting in the group chats that their enrolled in. 
2. Volunteer Moderators
	- The other users of the platform are volunteer moderators who will invigilate all the group chats on our platform. They will be responsible for ensuring civil discussion among all group chats, in addition to addressing user concerns. These may include addressing reports regarding other users and forwarding feedback from users to the developers. 


Scenarios
---------------------------
1. As a professor, I want a service that forms relationships between students, to enhance their overall university/ college experience.
2. As a user, I want to create an account where I can choose my university, year of study and program Iâ€™m enrolled in. 
3. As a user, I want to contribute to a group chat by sharing my lecture notes.
4. As a user, I want to update my information to include a profile avatar. 
5. As a user, I want to share the app with my peers who are not registered.
6. As a moderator, I want to ban users from specific group chats based on a credible user report. 


	
Software Design Principles
---------------------------
1. Simple to use UI
	- Minimalistic, clutter-free user-interface that allows for quick navigation to group chats and other parts of the platform
2. Swift notifications.
	- Notifications should be detailed but brief. Unread group chats should be clearly indicated to users. 
3. Suitable for educational purposes.
	- The user-interface is designed to focus primarily for university students and to limit customizability, ensuring a distraction-free environment.
4. Impeccable code design for future developers
	- Develop the application utilizing software design patterns to ensure abstraction, modularity, encapsulation & hierarchy while
	increasing cohesion and descreasing coupling within our code.
