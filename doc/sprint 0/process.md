Formation of Boundless
---------------------------
From the beginning of the course, leading up to Sprint 0, team Boundless was formed from 
utilizing many available technologies. The team was not formed by the members having 
similar ideas but, by just how different every member's ideas that were brought to the table. 
Plus a little bit of fluke, being that we are all enrolled in the same lecture section. The first 
lecture allowed each of us to research and analyze all the groups forming around us and with fate,
we developed a full seven member team. To keep every connected and up-to-date, we formed
a group chat on Facebook Messenger, since we found out we all frequently use the 
service already. Once the team became perpetual, we began our first in-person meeting. The 
following day after the first CSC301 lecture, we met for an hour to each introduce ourselves and 
pitch our ideas to one another. This meeting eventually turned into an Oscars for 'best software
project idea', which lead to the most agreed upon idea: Boundless. Boundless was initiated
when we agreed upon meeting up in-person twice a week to discuss development ideas (mimicking 
scrum meetings) for the next three months. Anything minor like forming the Github group or 
gathering each other's emails to create a Google Doc to share feature and other ideas, remained
online in the Facebook group chat. Otherwise everything else was taken to the twice-weekly 
in-person meetings where we can get everyones opinions to make decisions before execution in
Sprint 1. Usually our voting paradigm was not more than two rounds, which hopefully implies
we are all have similar aspirations. 

User stories, personas and features have all been discussed and finalized in our in-person
meetings. User stories were first developed during our initial project idea, when every member
was pitching their own ideas and how we could incorporate a piece of each idea into the final
version of Boundless. Through some more voting rounds, we were able to narrow down the
impeccable vision of Boundless, filtering out user stories, personas and features that would
throw off the trajectory our main intention. For those that remained, we began to add a priority
to every user story as well as a time estimation. It took some analysis to create the ordered 
structure of which user stories we should tackle first (because as we know, some stories are 
dependant on others such as needing to create an account before deleting one). Once we had
developed a vivid estimate of our roughly 15 user stories, we began to calculate how long it
would take to complete said stories. Years of knowledge and experience related to user story
'x' was taken into consideration when calculating how long each story would take. We finalized 
our stories by creating our Product Backlog with our desired features from user stories, similar
to the structure of Product Backlogs in CSC207, which can be found in the PB.md file.

Moving onto Sprint 1, we are confident we built a strong foundation that enables us to begin
execution of the Boundless project. However, some of the lessons that need to tag alongside
Boundless throughout its journey are: 
- Effectively communicating with teammates in a collaborative manner
- Ensure and enforce the basic software design principles throughout all phases of the
	project (those principles being abstraction, encapsulation, polymorphism and inheritance)
- Utilizing our tools like Github and Pivitol Tracker to manage our development in more detail
- Gurantee each sprint we fulfill basic expectations and satisfiers and aim towards fulfilling
	delighters as well 

After our latest meeting, we have the following assigned roles:
- Kevin Gao: Developer
- Abdulwasay Mehar: Developer
- William Gan: Developer
- Kenneth Chyzewski: Developer
- Jonathan Leung: Developer	
- Timm Ilyas: Developer
- Prashil Gandhi: Developer
