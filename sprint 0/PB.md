Below we have developed our product backlog including 16 user stories that
correspond to features within our application. The user stories were created
by following the INVEST model. User Story 0 also includes our DONE task, 
which is further explained in the done.md file. 

For our user-story priority scaling, we used the Fibonacci sequence taught in 
tutorial: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 with 34 having the highest priority

Using our in-person meeting process, described in the process.md file, we 
took all factors into consideration (Value, Risk, Knowledge, etc) when 
estimating how long each task will take and which sprint the stories will be 
completed in. Since we aim to complete 3-4 user stories during our bi weekly 
sprints, we ordered the tasks based on our purposed order of completion. This 
is our desired but, not yet finalized, 'Critical Path'. Excluding User Story 
0 as this User Story is the teams reminder of our end goal.

We do believe User stories 4-7 could potentially take up more than a single bi
weekly sprint thus, we will need to compensate and put our efforts into the
latter user stories, even if they are easier to implement and require less
man hours. However, user stories 4-7 cover the crucial component of Boundless'
functionality thus, we cannot push these stories any further back.
