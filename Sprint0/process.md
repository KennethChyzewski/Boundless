From the beginning of the course, leading up to Sprint 0, team Boundless was formed from 
utilizing many available technologies. The team was not formed by the members are having 
similar ideas but, by just how different every member's ideas that were brought to the table. 
And a little bit of fluke, mainly that we are all enrolled in the same lecture section. The first 
allowed each of us to research and analyze all the groups forming around us and with fate,
we ended up have a full seven member team. To keep every connected and up-to-date, we
formed a group chat on Facebook Messenger since we found out we all frequently use the 
service anyways. Once the team was set in stone, we began our first in-person meeting. The 
next day after the first CSC301 lecture, we met for an hour to each introduce ourselves and 
pitch our ideas to one another. This meeting eventually turned into a Oscars for best software
project idea, which lead to the most agreed upon idea: APP_NAME. Once set in stone the 
vision for the next four-ish months, we have agreed upon that we will meet up in-person 
twice a week to discuss development ideas (mimicking scrum meets) and thus, Boundless
was initiated. Anything minor like forming the Github group or gathering each other's emails
to create a Google Doc to share feature and other ideas, remained online in the Facebook
group chat. Otherwise everything else was taken to the twice-weekly in-person meetings
were we can get everyones opinions to make decisions before execution in Sprint 1. Usually
our voting paradigm was not more than two rounds, which hopefully implies we are all have
similar interests and are willing to work towards the same goal. 

User stories, personas and features have all been discussed and finalized in our in-person
meetings. User stories were first developed during our initial project idea, when every member
was pitching their own ideas and how we could incorporate a piece of each idea into the final
version of APP_NAME. Through some more voting rounds, we were able to narrow down the
impeccable vision of APP_NAME, filtering out user stories, personas and features that would
through off the trajectory our main intention. For those that remained, we began to add a priority
to every user story as well as a time estimation. It took some analysis to create the ordered 
structure of which user stories we should tackle first (because as we know, some stories are 
dependant on others such as needing to create an account before deleting one). Once we had
developed a vivid estimate of our roughly 20 user stories, we began to calculated how long it
would take to complete said stories. Years of knowledge and experience related to user story
'x' was taken into consideration when calculating how long each story would take. We finalized 
our stories by creating our Product Backlog with our desired features from user stories, similar
 to the structure of Product Backlogs in CSC207.

Moving onto Sprint 1, we are confident we built a strong foundation that enables us to begin
execution of the APP_NAME project. However, some of the lessons that need to tag alongside
Boundless through its journey are:
