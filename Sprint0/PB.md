Notes:
We are introduced to show you our app idea, blah. When you were in first year, do you wish there was an product that helped you find form new friend groups and find partners for assignments easier? Well thats were we stand today.
From chatting with students to who are enrolled in the same courses, to getting TAs assistance on projects to notifications on educational events (since who checks emails anymore) we have it all
Before developing the product, we need to develop an understanding of our users. Students. We know students 

We found that amongst all first years, majority arrive to a university or college with roughly 3 friends from their respective high school. And roughly 5% of first years (for an idea, utm has 8000 newcomers in 2018) attend the Frosh Week, making it rather difficult to offer support for students to network
Our app allows students to find students based on the courses theyre enrolled in, what year they are in (since this isnt restrictive to first year students) and what program they are in or interested in enrolling.
As students ourself, we know what problems we need to overcome throughout this project which enables us to evalulate and calculate the hurdles most students find when group searching.
Persona: We want students, those seeking new companions within the college/ university and those who carry smart devices (which is everyone nowadays)
Our BLAH: value proposition is to develops relationships before, during and after class hours to ensure students have the post-secondary experience they are paying for
When looking at the market of social media applications, there are many applications that have the intentions to create bonds between people such as facebook, instagram or even utms own student union app (which probably most of you didnt even knows existed). Our app filters out the sharing of content and outsider events to focus on the core relationship building functionality.
Business model: our model is to have the app totally free including free of ads
(if ilir asks "if the app is free and has no ads, then how the fuck do you make money". Then we whip out the ol 'we dont. were just that nice')
then we do app demo. Can be live or a video of the app working while talking
First a user makes an account (signs in with their university/ college email and password of their choice) followed by university/college and campus questions. Then another page will appear with either a schedule image scanner or simply entering the courses you are enrolled in. Once completed, the student will automatically be added to the selected chat forums and subscribed to the default notifications list which will give students a weekly message of how many students joined and left said chatrooms as well as what events are happneing on their campus
We do this because we need to know a little bit more about you and how we can personalize your experience. (make a slide with a checklist of our features when compared to say facebook and instagram)
When advertising our product, facebook and instagram are the best soruces for 2 reasons. 1.  Trivially the biggest audience and 2. Both services can find out which set of users are students or mid-to-end highschool students and are more likely to try out our app
