The users of APP_NAME are strictly students. No TAs, No instructors/ Professors, No counsellors. 
This app is built by students, for the students. We need a relationship-building platform that filters
out any middle-men, third-party services or principles. 

Our product's competitors are Facebook, Discord, Slack, Whatsapp and (for UTM specifically) 
UTM's UTSU in the manner of multi-person forums that everyone can connect and communicate
with. In the socializing and forming bonds aspect, our competitors are Instagram, Piazza and 
Discussion Board that allow students to gain insight on what other students are discussing about 
and form new discussions. APP_NAME differs as it enters both markets by offering a sociable 
community to enhance a students university/ college experience by increasing their personal
network. Boundless wants to create the open discussion forums thats are not behind anonymous 
usernames to allow students to introduce themselves and collaborate with others who are 
enrolled in the same courses or the same program within the users specific campus. We also
have no adds to ensure an authentic experience when using the app. We also have no point
or rating system because we want to ensure a positive and engaging environment for everyone.

Boundless believe one feature that most public apps do not take into consider is 'group
personalization'. Most app developers ensure their app(s) are personalized for each individual
user with the intention to offer a better experience. APP_NAME, with its intention of relationship
construction, personalizes the user experience based on the students enrolment. APP_NAME
dives into a person's university/college, their university's/college's specific campus, their
program(s) and their specific enrolled courses to match them up with people have similar
interests and life aspirations. Boundless believe competitors do not do 'group personalization' to
avoid having people feel 'left out' however, our goal is formulated via isolation. We developed
encapsulated environments by modulating students to their specific interests, similar to how on
Facebook and Instagram, a user can like or follow a page that intrigues them. The search for 
'personalized groups' is also a feature that no other competitor does. Yes, they offer suggested
pages but APP_NAME collects your enrolment information and creates the personalized group
instantaneously, removing the need for users to search for potential friend groups.
