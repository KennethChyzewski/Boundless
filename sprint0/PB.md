State your team’s numerical series you do intend to use to estimate user stories (examples from tutorials).
• Identify the most important user stories.
• How many user stories? We are not sure. Enough to give us (and you) a good sense of the scope of
the project.
• As a guideline: a user story (usually) corresponds to a feature in your project.
• Any number between 3 and 20 might be appropriate.
• Each user story must obey the format stated in the lecture and it must also contain the criteria of
satisfaction.
• Each user story should include a priority and a point estimate (using the numerical scale stated above).
• Point estimate is a qualitative estimate, made by the team members. You will need to use planning
poker as in tutorials.

Below we have developed our product backlog including 20 user stories that
correspond to features within our application. User Story 0 also includes
our DONE task, which is mentioned in the done.md file. 

For our user-story priority scaling, we used the Fibonacci sequence taught in 
tutorial: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 with 34 having the highest priority

Using our in-person meeting process, mentioned in the process.md file, we 
took all factors into consideration (Value, Risk, Knowledge etc) when 
estimating how long each task will take and which sprint they will be completed 
in. Since we aim to complete 4-5 user stories bi weekly, we ordered the tasks 
based on our purposed order of completion.
